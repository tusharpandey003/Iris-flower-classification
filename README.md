# Iris flower classification
Iris flower have three categories- Versicolor, Sentosa ,Virginca. On  the basis of there sepal_length, sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width.
There are total two separte approches for iris flower classification in this Repository.
This repository consists one Jupyter notebook(IRIS flower classification.ipynb) and one app.py file.

In app.py 
This is a web application using Streamlit which using Random Forest Algorithm to classify the iris flower .


 In IRIS flower classification.ipynb
 This notebook uses machine learning algorithm approach and clearly describes all the steps to classify the iris flower using KNN algorithm.
 using IRIS.data we first load the dataset and then split it into train,validation,test dataset.Then train with KNN and then checking Accuracy via classification report and confusion matrix.
 then Test it onto New data(matrix)
